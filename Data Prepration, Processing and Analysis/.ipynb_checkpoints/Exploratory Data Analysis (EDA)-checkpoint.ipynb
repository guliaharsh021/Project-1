    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Statistics:\n",
    "- Generated summary statistics for numerical features: Property Size, Price Total, and Price per Sqft.\n",
    "- Computed basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max for these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution Plots:\n",
    "- Plot histograms and box plots for Property Size and Price Total.\n",
    "- Create bar plots for categorical features: Property Type and City/Locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Value Analysis:\n",
    "- Identify and visualize the missing values in the dataset.\n",
    "- Calculate the percentage of missing values for each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Analysis:\n",
    "- Create a correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical features.\n",
    "- Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.\n",
    "- Highlight any strong positive or negative correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### City/Locality Analysis:\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of properties across different cities/localities.\n",
    "- Create bar plots to visualize the count of properties in each city/locality.\n",
    "- Investigate the average property size and price in each city/locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Type Analysis:\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of different property types.\n",
    "- Create bar plots to visualize the count of each property type.\n",
    "- Investigate the average property size and price for each property type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Price Analysis:\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of property prices.\n",
    "- Create histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of Price Total and Price per Sqft.\n",
    "- Investigate the relationship between property size and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Size Analysis:\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of property sizes.\n",
    "- Create histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of Property Size.\n",
    "- Investigate the relationship between property size and price per sqft.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Furnishing Analysis:\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of properties based on furnishing status.\n",
    "- Create bar plots to visualize the count of properties in each furnishing category (if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Analysis for Specific Property Types:\n",
    "- Perform a detailed analysis for specific property types such as \"Residential-Plot\".\n",
    "- Compare the summary statistics and distribution plots for different property types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering:\n",
    "- Create new features if applicable, such as price per unit area (Price Total/Property Size).\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of these new features on the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization Summary:\n",
    "- Summarize key findings with relevant visualizations.\n",
    "- Create a dashboard or report to present the insights gained from the EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- Summarize the main insights and patterns observed from the EDA.\n",
    "- Discuss any potential next steps or further analysis that could be conducted based on the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this EDA outline, you can comprehensively analyze the real estate dataset and gain valuable insights into the properties' characteristics, distribution, and relationships."
